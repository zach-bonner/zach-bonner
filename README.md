# Hi, I’m Zach Bonner

I like solving problems, breaking things (on purpose), and automating anything that can be automated. My background is in debugging, automation, data analysis, and software optimization, with a strong focus on making systems run better, faster, and with fewer headaches.

I enjoy writing code that saves time, reduces errors, and makes people’s lives easier—whether it’s Python scripts for automation, Bash for system tasks, or the occasional Swift project just for fun.

## Things I’m into:
	•	Automation & tooling – Because if I have to do it twice, it’s getting scripted.
	•	Data analysis & debugging – Finding patterns, fixing weird edge cases, and making things work properly.
	•	Building scalable solutions – Good software should make life easier, not harder.

## Tech I use regularly:

Python, Bash, AppleScript, Swift, MongoDB, Firebase
